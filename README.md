# GaeilgeNLP
Future home of our ruby gem for interacting as Gaeilge. 🍀

## Modules

### Spell check
Build a [spell check algorithm](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) to check for spelling (grá na ghaeilge vs gar na gheailge) using ngrams. I've reached out to http://www.forasnagaeilge.ie/ to use their irish corpora. Fingers crossed!
